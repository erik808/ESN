* Here's a todo list

** TODO [#A] setup a few unit tests
   - The python code should be a port and do exactly what the
     matlab code does.
   - [ ] So feed a few critical members with deterministic arrays and
     compare with matlab or octave output for the related member in
     matlab.

** TODO [#B] setup continuous integration
   - [ ] either in the gitlab repo
   - [ ] or on github

** TODO [#C] integrate with pytorch
   - [ ] let this implementation be a cell
   - [ ] implement other cells, like GRU, LSTM
