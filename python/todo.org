* Here's a todo list

** TODO setup unit test
   - The python code should be a port and do exactly what the matlab
     code does.

   - So feed a few critical members with deterministic arrays and
     compare with matlab or octave output for the related member in
     matlab.

** TODO setup continuous integration
   - either in the gitlab repo
   - or on github
